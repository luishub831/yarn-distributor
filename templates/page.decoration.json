It’s ideal for online stores, on-demand campaigns and short runs that don’t justify screen setup.</p><p>Because there are no screens, you can oer your clients multiple designs or personalised prints with low setup fees to every variation. You get low minimums, fast changeovers and a soft hand feel on the garment, all produced under your brand.<br/><br/></p>",
